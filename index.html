                        <p>A short introduction about myself:
                            Why you chose your course
                            Areas of tech or other fields that interest you
                            Hobbies or interests (optional, if professionally relevant)
                            Career ambitions or future goal
                            I chose to study Maths and Computer science teaching because I always liked teaching and I
                            enjoyed maths during school.
                            I had a very good maths teacher who is one of my role models for my career.
                            Technology in cars and how machines work or operate is a field i find very interesting.
                            I have developed an interest in coding and computer science due to my studies.
                            It was very eye opening how useful programming is and how many applications it has. </p>

                            <h3>My Technical Skills and education</h3>
                            <p>My skills have mainly been developed through college.
                                Some of the skills I have wanted to improve independently so I have done some online
                                courses.
                                I have also done some coding in my free time to help me improve my skills.
                                Once I am a qualified teacher I will need to teach the students how to code.
                                I will need to be proficient in coding to be able to teach the students.
                            </p>

                            <p>I started mountain biking 7 years ago after getting to try it in a local forest.
                                It is a great hobby to have as it is a great way to get out and get some
                                exercise.
                                I raced my first race 5 years ago and have been racing ever since.
                                I have been lucky enough to have been able to travel to different countries for
                                racing.
                                I am a member of the committee for the UL road and mountain biking club.
                                As part of the committee I help organise cycles for beginners and experienced
                                cyclists.
                                I also help lead the cycles and help with any issues that may arise.
                                This year I am on a Sport scholarship for Mountain biking.
                                This has helped me improve my training and racing.

                                Mountain Bikes are highly specialized and designed for off-road riding.
                                They are designed to be durable and strong enough to handle rough terrain.
                                The tyres are wide to help with grip. The suspension helps with the bumps and
                                big hits.
                                The brakes are hydraulic disc brakes which are very powerful and similar to
                                brakes on a car or motorbike.

                            <p>Greg Callaghan is one of my main inspirations. He is one of Irelands best
                                mountain bikers. He has been racing for many years and has been very successful.
                                Greg has been on the podium at the Enduro World Series which is the highest level
                                of racing in the world. He is aslo multiple time Irish National Champion. He is
                                a very skilled rider and has a very good attitude towards racing.
                                He is now 33 years old and has been racing for 10 years.
                                For a few years he was Irelands only professional mountain biker.
                                He is now sponsored by Red Bull.

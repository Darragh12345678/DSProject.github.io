    <h1>Report:</h1>
    <p>I started by laying out my Web page by drawing it out on paper and boxifying my design.
        Then I started making the divs in the html and deciding what colours and styles they should have.
        I commented on some of the main divs the color they were in my boxified design.
        This helped me lay the webpage out correctly when I was coding it.
        <br>
        I then started to add the css to style the page. I added the background color and the font color and size.
        I then added the padding and margin to the divs to space them out correctly.
